        <h2>Hello</h2>
        
        <p>Weather impacts nearly every area of our lives â€“ Weather conditions such as fog, rain, and snow impact commutes to work and travels to places in other parts of the world. 
        <p>Weather impacts our health as it has a direct effect on the air we breathe (air quality), the water we drink, and the food we eat.</p>

Weather impacts our safety as severe weather such as hurricanes, tornadoes, and floods often cause sudden mass destruction to homes, buildings, and other infrastructure.</p>
<p>Thanks to satellites, radar, remote sensors, and other weather monitoring technologies (such as National Weather Service alerts), we now have a better understanding of weather conditions and phenomena.</p>
